# RC Dirt Oval — build-from-scratch prompt

Paste this whole file to an AI coding agent to rebuild the game. It is the single source
of truth: current, deduplicated, and trimmed to what actually matters. Work in a **loop** —
every milestone ends in a runnable build you **verify on screen** (screenshot or read sim
state) before moving on.

## What to build
A polished, shareable **browser 3D, 1/10-scale dirt-oval RC racing game**, modeled on the real
**Team Losi 22S Sprint** (TLR 22 platform). It must be a real deliverable: `npm run build` produces
a static `dist/` that runs from any static host with no server. Driver-stand camera, sim-leaning
physics, a 15-round career, full **random 8–12-car fields**. **Two player car classes** — a
**winged sprint car** and a **dirt late model** — each with its own body, physics baseline, and
independent career. **Two game modes** — **Career/Sim** (the points championship) and **Arcade**
(RC Pro-Am style: an overhead chase camera + oil/wet slick patches, a score, top-3-or-continue gate).
A single **unified setup screen** sets driver name + car class + game mode + sound on/off +
**auto-throttle**, then START (all persisted); both modes launch off a drag-strip light tree (see
GAME MODES). **Audio:** a procedural **high-revving combustion sprint-car engine** for the *player*
car **plus** a lighter, stereo-panned, distance-faded engine for **every AI car** (Web Audio; pitch
tracks throttle/speed; mute with **M** / HUD button, persisted; pausing silences it).

## Tech stack
- **Babylon.js 7** (`@babylonjs/core`, `@babylonjs/materials`) imported **à la carte** (not the
  barrel) for a small bundle. Remember the **side-effect imports**: standard/PBR materials,
  shadow + physics scene components, prepass + geometryBuffer (for SSAO2).
- **Havok** physics via `@babylonjs/havok` (WASM), async-initialized before the first step.
- **Vite 5 + TypeScript 5**, strict (`noUnusedLocals/Parameters/noImplicitReturns`).
- No test runner, no linter. **`npm run build` (tsc --noEmit then vite build) is the only gate.**
- `localStorage` for career/setup/class persistence.

## Core architecture (do these exactly — each was learned the hard way)
- **The vehicle is custom and KINEMATIC — never a Havok rigid body.** `RaycastVehicle`
  integrates its own planar velocity (slip-based friction-circle tires), its own yaw
  (bicycle model + slip oversteer + throttle-steer), and raycasts the ground each step for ride
  height + banking. Havok is used **only** for static track collision and wheel rays. (Havok
  `applyForce` on a dynamic body desynced velocity from the mesh — that path is abandoned.)
- **Car-to-car contact and wall limits are POSITIONAL**, not physics — resolved in a `Field`
  class that also owns surface grip, tire wear, dust, and rollovers for the whole field.
- **Rollovers are marshal-gated.** A hard hit triggers a realistic **multi-axis rollover** that
  leaves the car **stuck** (no control/velocity) until a marshal rights it; the player can tap **R**
  to bail out.
- **Fixed-timestep accumulator**: `FIXED = 1/60`, ≤6 catch-up steps/frame, so the sim runs at
  real-world speed when FPS dips. Each step: `Field.update(dt, input, raceFraction)`.
- Single entry point `main.ts` with a game-flow state machine: `attract → prerace → racing →
  finished`. Expose `window.__field/__track/__race/__marshals/__cockpit/__audio` for tests.
- **Pause menu** (`P` / a HUD ⏸ button): **Resume / Restart / Main Menu** — freezes the fixed-timestep
  accumulator, the race clock, and the engine sound, then resumes cleanly.
- **Boot/loading progress bar + opening logo**: the `#loading` splash shows the **SUPER JAY #32
  racing badge** (`public/superjay-32.png`) above a real app-build progress bar (`setBootProgress`,
  staged engine→physics→track→ready 10/20/50/85/100%) that fades out when the scene is ready, and
  credits **"Created by Aaron Blair."**
- **Unified setup screen (`Screens.setup`)**: a single start screen replaces the old
  class→mode→pre-race→name chain. It sets **driver name** (pre-filled with the saved name, default
  "Super Jay"; title-case + persist it, set `player.name`), **car class** (Winged Sprint Car / Dirt
  Late Model), **game mode** (Career/Sim vs Arcade — see GAME MODES), **sound on/off**, and
  **auto-throttle** on/off, then START. Every setting is **persisted + remembered** for next time
  (`localStorage["rcdirtoval.*"]`); changing class or mode persists + reloads + **auto-starts** so the
  field/career rebuild. Then run the **light-tree** start sequence (see GAME MODES).
- **Auto-throttle** (persisted): when on, the car runs **full throttle always** and the **only input
  is steering** (the touch GAS/BRAKE pedals hide); desktop + mobile.

## WORLD SCALE (the rule that prevents the recurring sizing bug)
**Only the cars and the track are 1:10 scale. Everything else is FULL REAL-WORLD size** —
marshals, flag girl, drivers'-stand spectators, the lawnmower rider, the drivers' stand,
the timing booth, and any future person/prop/building.
- Working metric: **1 game unit ≈ 1 foot.**
- Targets: standing adult ≈ **5.7u**; drivers'-stand deck ≈ **5u** (5 ft); shack/booth ≈ **9u**;
  a 1:10 car ≈ **2.5u** long / ~2.5u tall to the wing. People read ~2× a car's height and
  clearly tower over the toy cars.
- Build procedural figures feet-anchored (root origin at the ground, y=0) and scale the root:
  `scale = 5.7 / nativeHeight` (~3.5× on a ~1.6u native figure). Seated/podium figures scale
  the whole assembly so the **person** lands near target.

## Game shape
- **Four camera views** (`view` enum incl. `normal|incar|aerial|proam`; **always starts at Track each race**; `?view=` override):
  the **driver-stand** follow cam (elevated trackside RC vantage that aims at the car, pans into
  corners, telephoto-zooms to the far side), a first-person **in-car/cockpit** cam (`CockpitCamera.ts`)
  parented to the player car root so it inherits heading/pitch/roll/bank, plus a subtle lean-into-corner
  + speed shake/FOV (falls back to the external cam during a flip), a high **aerial** overview, and an
  **RC Pro-Am overhead** view where the player car stays centered while the track scrolls under it
  (the Arcade default). An **upper-left button + V** cycle the views; **C** still quick-toggles aerial.
  **Manual zoom** works in every view (mouse wheel / `+`/`-` keys / on-screen touch `±` buttons). New
  cameras must join the default pipeline AND the `ssao` pipeline. A hidden **`?photo`** mode locks a
  close rear-3/4 camera onto the player car (shares the post-FX) to show off the bodywork.
- **Attract intro** (once per tab session via `sessionStorage`): the whole field is AI-driven
  under a cinematic "broadcast" camera that cuts between crane orbit, low trackside, chase,
  and flyby; title card overlaid; any click/key flags seen and reloads into the menu with a
  fresh grid. Reads like a video (HUD hidden).
- **`?demo`** skips attract+menu straight into a live race; **`?round=N`** (1-based) forces a
  career round for previewing; **`?class=sprint|latemodel`** forces a class; **`?mode=career|arcade`**
  forces a game mode; **`?day`/`?night`** force lighting. Combine them.
- **A flag girl** at the start/finish waves the green flag on the countdown GO.
- **HUD**: lap, position, interval gaps ahead/behind, last vs best lap, speed (mph-scaled),
  tire %, track state, minimap, plus a pause (⏸) button and zoom `±` controls. A polished in-game
  **driver's manual** overlay opens from the title and pre-race screens. On-screen **touch controls**
  on phones (steer pad + GAS/BRAKE/RESET + zoom `±`; GAS/BRAKE hide when auto-throttle is on).

## Car classes (`CarClass.ts`)
Two classes the player picks on the unified setup screen; `CAR_CLASSES`/`CAR_CLASS_LIST` map each id to its
**body builder + pristine physics baseline**, cloned per car. `loadCarClass`/`saveCarClass` persist
the pick (`localStorage["rcdirtoval.class"]`, `?class=` override). `Field` takes a `CarClassDef` and
builds every car via `classDef.build`. Careers are **class-keyed** (`loadCareer(cls)`/`saveCareer(c,
cls)` under `rcdirtoval.career.<cls>`, with a one-time migration of the old single-class save into
`sprint`). `SetupPanel` shows the class label.

1. **Winged Sprint Car** (`Car.ts` / `DEFAULT_CONFIG`) — light, twitchy, wing-downforce, power-oversteer.
2. **Dirt Late Model** (`LateModel.ts` / `LATE_MODEL_CONFIG`) — heavy, planted, mechanical grip, no wing.

### Handling knobs (`VehicleConfig`)
Tune feel through the config + slip/grip math. Beyond grip/steer basics, two yaw "looseness" gains
distinguish the classes: **`slipSteer`** (how much a lateral slide rotates the car — oversteer) and
**`throttleSteer`** (how much throttle rotates the car through a corner — dirt power-steer). Sprint =
loose (0.6 / 0.015); late model = planted (0.42 / 0.009) + more grip + no downforce. *(Note: `mass`
and suspension stiffness/damping are currently cosmetic in the kinematic model — a "real load
transfer" pass is a known future improvement; the heavy/planted feel is tuned via the grip/steer
scalars for now.)*

## Game modes (`game/Mode.ts`, `game/Arcade.ts`)
Two modes the player picks on the **unified setup screen** (along with name/class/sound/auto-throttle).
`loadMode`/`saveMode` persist the pick (`localStorage["rcdirtoval.mode"]`, `?mode=career|arcade`
override); arcade run-state (`{round, continues, score}`) persists in `localStorage["rcdirtoval.arcade"]`.
Changing class or mode persists + reloads + auto-starts. `finalize()` in `main.ts` branches the results
handling by mode.

**Light-tree start (BOTH modes):** replace the plain 3-2-1 text countdown with a drag-strip **light
tree** (`Screens.arcadeLightTree`: staging dots → three ambers → GREEN, with "GET READY"/"GO!"),
firing the green flag at the same ~2.4s moment. A **perfect-launch boost**: hitting the gas within
~350ms of green grants a brief acceleration buff (`main.ts`).

1. **Career/Sim** — the championship season as specified everywhere else: always-advance progression,
   points keyed by driver name. **Unchanged** by the arcade work.
2. **Arcade (RC Pro-Am style)** — `ArcadeManager` (`game/Arcade.ts`) defaults to the **RC Pro-Am
   overhead camera** (the car stays centered while the track scrolls under it) and scatters **oil/wet
   slick patches** (any car — transient grip loss → slides) on the oval. *(The old box pickups,
   collectible letters, and boost strips were **removed** — only the slicks remain.)* A score accrues.
   **Advancement**: must finish **top-3** to advance; otherwise burn one of ~3 **continues** — out of
   continues resets the run. An **arcade HUD** (`#arcadeHud`, Score / Continues) shows only in arcade
   mode; expose `window.__arcade` for tests.

**Temporary buff layer on the vehicle (`RaycastVehicle.ts`)**: `applyBuff(kind:"grip"|"accel"|"top",
mult, seconds)`, `grantImmunity(seconds)`, and `buffState()` — ticked/decayed in `update()` and woven
into the grip/accel/top-speed math; immunity short-circuits `triggerRollover`. Behavior must be
identical when no buff is active (so Career/Sim physics are untouched).

## Cars — must look PICTURE-PERFECT (hard visual bar)
Every car (player + AI, both classes) reads clean at all times: four corner tires, wings/spoiler on,
body/livery intact, driver + helmet, nothing missing/floating/clipping. Build procedurally.

**Winged sprint car (`Car.ts`):**
- Body tub/tail/nose; a big raked **top wing** (down-swept front scoop, tall lettered side
  boards with car number, wickerbill) on a chrome wing tree; smaller front wing.
- Exposed sprint front end: round **nerf-bar nose hoop**, tubular **straight front axle** on
  4-bar radius rods + tie rod, king-pins, torsion shocks. Roll cage, nerf bars, engine block,
  rear coilovers, **chrome swept-up "zoomie" exhaust headers**.
- **Staggered tires** (biggest right-rear) on **orange beadlock** wheels.
- Hero car = **Super Jay's orange #32** (plain-orange body, small "Super Jay" by the cockpit,
  his logo laid on the all-orange wing).

**Dirt late model (`LateModel.ts`):** a real 1:10 RC dirt late model — a **low, wide, full-bodied
wedge** with big **fenders covering the wheels**, a **small narrow cab set back**, tall **sail panels**,
a wide flat **raked spoiler**, and a low **full-width nose + splitter**; numbered-roundel door livery +
roof number, **mild** stagger, machined-silver beadlocks. The visual opposite of the sprinter.

**Both:** tires are **revolved from a cross-section with a lathe** (rounded shoulders, square-ish
tread). No sidewall/shoulder mesh may exceed the tread radius (a too-big torus bulge = Mickey-Mouse
ears). Set the tire material `backFaceCulling = false` (revolved carcass is single-sided). Per-wheel
radius feeds wheel placement so big tires don't sink/float. PBR paint + clearcoat; per-side liveries
on canvas DynamicTextures (mirror text on the left). Distinct color + number per grid slot, with the
**AI cars carrying wing-top numbers** and an **always-present red/white #42** in the field; AI run
**stable random full names** (`AI_NAMES` in Career.ts) so the championship (points keyed by name)
stays coherent. **After ANY change to car building / wheel placement / spawning, screenshot the full
grid and verify before calling it done.**

## Tracks (data-driven)
- A `TrackDef` holds cornerRadius, straightLength, width, banking (rad), baseGrip, gripFalloff,
  rutIntensity, aiSkill, fieldSize, laps, dirtColor, difficulty, `night`, and `backdrop`
  (mesas/forest/plains/city/dunes/badlands).
- `OvalTrack` builds a **counter-clockwise banked stadium oval** (2 straights + 2 180° turns)
  with walls, **uniform brown packed-dirt racing surface** (contiguous full-width ribbons all
  one earthy brown — NO painted multi-shade groove bands; grip evolves per line in `SurfaceModel`,
  and the **driven racing groove visibly darkens** over a run as it rubbers/packs in), a **grassed
  infield** carrying a large Flora Vista speedway logo sprayed flat onto it (bundled image asset,
  alpha/matte), and centerline helpers `project()/sampleAt()/gridPose()`. Put the **start/finish
  line ~¾ of the way down the front stretch**.
- `generateCareer()` → **15 progressively harder** ovals (radius shrinks, straights lengthen,
  width narrows, grip drops/falls off faster, ruts + AI rise, laps + field grow, banking ramps
  to ~0.20–0.24 rad). Distinct dirt color + backdrop per round. **Each race runs a random 8–12-car
  field** (`def.fieldSize = 8 + rand(0..4)` per load; keep the colour `PALETTE` + `DRIVER_NUMBERS`
  ≥ 12 long).
- **The game runs at NIGHT, game-wide** (`def.night = true` forced in `main.ts` — dark sky, crescent
  moon + starfield, lit lamp towers). This night look is the game's identity; **do NOT ship daytime
  racing.** The calendar still marks rounds 8/12/15; `?day` is a **dev-only** preview override. Keep
  night bright enough that the cars read (don't crush them into shadow).

## Marshals, flag girl, easter egg (all REAL-WORLD size — see WORLD SCALE)
- **6 track marshals**: **2 sit in camp chairs at the two infield ends** (one chair per end) and
  **4 stand outside the track at the corners** (evenly spread, turns 1–4). They wait until there's
  trouble. When a car is **wrecked (stuck upside down)** OR **stalled** (stopped / pointing the
  wrong way at near-zero speed for ~3 s while green), the **nearest available** marshal (seated or
  standing) gets up/jogs across traffic to it and **places the car back on the racing line, upright,
  facing race direction, ready to continue** (via `vehicle.resetTo(pos, yaw)` using `track.project()`
  → nearest centerline + tangent), then returns to its post (re-seating or standing). Give each
  marshal a `seated` flag so it returns to the right posture.
- **Rigged, animated figures**: `buildPerson` builds legs on **hip+knee pivots** and arms on
  **shoulder pivots** (rest pose reads identical to a plain standing figure), exposed via a
  `personRigs` WeakMap. A marshal **animates a full jog cycle** (legs swing from the hips, knees
  bend, arms counter-swing) while moving to/from an incident, and returns to rest when standing/
  seated/working. Static figures (spectators) just leave the rig at rest.
- **Extremities on every figure**: every person built by `buildPerson` (marshals + the deck
  spectators), plus the **flag girl** and the **lawnmower rider**, has visible **shoes, hands, and
  knee joints** — the knees/feet/hands ride the same hip/knee/shoulder rig pivots, so the marshals'
  jog and the flag wave animate the new parts too. World scale is unchanged (≈5.7u, feet at y≈0).
- **Flag girl** at the start/finish on a small podium; `greenFlag()` fires a big wave from the
  countdown GO and the `?demo` start, decaying to idle.
- **Marshal variety**: varied looks (shirt/hair/skin/headwear/cap) so no two read identically.
- **Easter egg**: a guy on a red riding mower parked on the infield grass by the logo (static).
- Build figures from cheap primitives (cylinders/capsules/spheres) under one feet-anchored
  `TransformNode` root; freeze static meshes; animated parts go under a child pivot.

## Scenery & lighting (`Scenery.ts`, `Environment.ts`)
- Real-size **drivers' stand**, **doubled in length** (~5u/5 ft deck, rails, ~8 **varied full-size
  spectators** built via the marshals' `buildPerson`/`spectatorLooks` — arms, varied shirts, some
  caps, some long hair — **yawed to face the track (−x) with arms posed forward, each holding a
  procedural RC transmitter** (thumbsticks + antenna) as if driving), with a **banner** and a **lit
  booth window**, on the front straight; tailgate-party **pickup trucks** (full real-world scale)
  parked behind the grandstand + along the east straight; a start/finish gantry; **6 light towers**
  (4 corners + 2 mid-straight) whose PointLights light at night.
- Per-round **themed backdrop** silhouette + a large **world floor** (~1700u) under everything
  (the 400m infield only covers ±200m, so distant scenery needs ground to the horizon). A
  backdrop instance must never reach inboard of the outfield (clamp its radius by half its
  width) or it clips the track.
- **Day**: bright SkyMaterial dome, blue sky/haze, full IBL + sun. **Night** (rounds 8/12/15): dark
  dome, cool dark fog, lower IBL, a brighter cool **moon-key** sun + lit towers, plus a **crescent
  moon** (billboarded emissive disc with an offset punch-out), a **star dome** (emissive random-dot
  DynamicTexture, `applyFog=false`, emissive > 1 so bloom catches them), and a **Big Dipper** asterism
  (billboarded bright dots, north-up, pointer stars toward Polaris), all positioned UP among the
  stars. Keep night bright enough that the cars read (don't crush them into shadow).
- Rendering: prefiltered IBL `.env`, ACES tonemap, bloom, SSAO2, FXAA + sharpen, light haze.
  Cap shadow-map cost (`refreshRate = 2` — every other frame) since most casters are static.
  Dust = a `ParticleSystem` per car set to `BLENDMODE_STANDARD` (Babylon defaults to additive →
  glowing embers), tinted from dirtColor. Avoid ground moiré: `anisotropicFilteringLevel = 16`,
  modest tiling, low bump level. Camera `maxZ` must exceed the skybox size and the star-dome radius.
- **Adaptive graphics quality** (`QualityManager.ts`): an auto-tuning controller that holds ~60 FPS by
  walking a **5-tier ladder** over render detail — hardware scaling (render resolution), MSAA,
  SSAO, bloom, and sharpen — stepping down when `engine.getFps()` dips and climbing back to max when
  the GPU has headroom, with **hysteresis + a cooldown** so it doesn't oscillate. `setupEnvironment`
  returns `EnvHandles { pipeline, ssao }` (the knobs it drives); `main.ts` calls `quality.update()`
  each frame and exposes `window.__quality` as a test hook. The tiers **multiply onto the base
  hardware-scaling level**, so the lighter mobile/phone base is preserved (desktop starts high, phones
  lighter); the shadow-map size stays fixed.

## Audio (`src/audio/MotorSound.ts`)
Pure procedural **Web Audio** (no file to ship). **Player car**: emulate a **high-revving combustion
sprint-car engine** — a rich, harmonically dense voice whose pitch/rev tracks `speed`+throttle, plus a
faint speed-scaled white-noise tire/dirt hiss — all through a **low-pass that opens with throttle**
(keep the cutoff high enough to stay audible) under a **master-gain cap**. **AI field**: a cheaper tier
— `setVoiceCount(n)` makes one lightweight osc→gain→**stereo panner** voice per other car, and
`updateVoices(...)` each frame pitches/pans/distance-fades them to the active camera so the pack is a
background, not a swarm. The `AudioContext` starts suspended; `resume()` on the first user gesture
(autoplay policy), then `update(throttle, speed)` + `updateVoices` each physics step **only while
racing**. Smooth params with `setTargetAtTime`. **Pausing silences the engine.** **Mute** with `M` / a
HUD 🔊 button → master gain 0 (mutes everything), persisted to `localStorage["rcdirtoval.muted"]`.
Degrade to a silent no-op if `AudioContext` is unavailable.

## AI, career, input
- 8–10 AI per field following the racing line with per-track difficulty + variance, drafting,
  slide jobs, inside defense, and pace bobbles for a shuffling pack. Sensible, varied finishes.
- Career: points (25,20,16,13,11,9,7,5,4,3,2,1), standings, save/load **per car class**. In **Career/Sim
  mode** the season **always advances** to the next (harder) round from results — no podium gate; finale
  shows the champion. (**Arcade mode** instead gates advancement on a **top-3** finish, spending a
  continue otherwise — see GAME MODES.)
- **Race end**: a race **ends one lap after the winner** crosses the start/finish line (the field gets a
  clean final lap), not the instant the leader finishes; rank finished cars by **finish time**.
- **Early-career speed boost** (`main.ts`): on career levels 1–7 the **player car only** gets
  `engineForce *= 1 + 0.15*(7-round)/7` (+15% at level 1, tapering to 0 by level 8), so the opening
  rounds feel forgiving and the field catches up as you climb. AI cars and the class physics
  baselines are left untouched.
- Input: keyboard (arrows/WASD drive — steer only with auto-throttle on, R reset, V cycle camera view,
  C quick-aerial, P pause, mouse-wheel / `+`/`-` zoom, G garage, M mute, K/J rig calibrate); standard
  gamepad (stick steer, RT/LT throttle/brake); **self-calibrating Logitech Flight Yoke + CH Pro Pedals**
  (learn resting axes: centered = steering, extreme = pedals; only switch off keyboard once the rig
  actually moves); **on-screen touch controls** on phones (steer pad + GAS/BRAKE/RESET + zoom `±`;
  GAS/BRAKE hide when auto-throttle is on; set `touch-action:none` on each control + cancel multi-touch
  `touchmove` to stop iOS pinch-zoom from scrolling them off).

## Verification (the user judges on look & feel)
- Headless renders at ~1–5 fps, so the dt clamp slows the sim. For deterministic tests, **step
  the sim synchronously at fixed dt in page script and read internal state** (`vehicle.heading`,
  `vehicle.position`) — not `mesh.getDirection()` (stale until a render frame).
- Use real-GPU headless Chrome screenshots of the dev server (the Playwright WebGL shot of this
  canvas is stale/garbled). `?demo` = driver-stand POV; plain `?round=N` = attract wide; `?photo` =
  close car. Screenshot the **full grid** for car correctness; use `?class=latemodel` to check the
  late model too.
- **Backdrops and the night sky (moon/stars) barely show in the bowl-pitched cameras** — verify them
  by freezing the scene (`scene.onBeforeRenderObservable.clear()`), aiming a camera at the sky,
  `render()`, then screenshotting; or in the attract wide shots.
- **Verify figure scale deterministically**: read a figure's world bounding-box height via
  `browser_evaluate` and confirm ≈5.7u with feet at y≈0.

## Distribution (cross-platform)
- **Live URL:** `https://aaronjblair.github.io/RC-Dirt-Oval/` (GitHub Pages, auto-deploys on push to `main`).
- **Installable PWA** (`vite-plugin-pwa`): the build emits a **web-app manifest** and a **service
  worker** that **precaches the whole game including the Havok `.wasm`**, so it installs as a real app
  with its own icon and runs offline on **iOS / Android / Windows / Mac** (iOS Safari: *Share → Add to
  Home Screen*; Android / desktop Chrome or Edge: the **Install app** button). Icons are generated by
  `scripts/gen-icons.mjs` → `public/pwa-192.png` / `pwa-512.png` / `pwa-maskable-512.png` /
  `apple-touch-icon-180.png`.
- **Windows `.exe`** via **Electron + electron-builder** (`electron/main.cjs`, `electron-builder.yml`).
  `npm run build:win` runs `scripts/build-win.mjs`, which builds `dist/` then packages from a **temp
  directory** to dodge the electron-builder **EPERM** error on the project tree → `release/*Setup*.exe`
  (gitignored; shipped as a **GitHub Release** asset). The **`rebuild`** skill orchestrates docs →
  build → executables → publish → links.
- **No native iOS / Mac / Android store builds** are produced — install the PWA from the URL above
  (it covers all three).

## Commands
```
npm install
npm run dev      # http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run build    # tsc --noEmit (strict) then vite build -> dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build
npm run build:win # Windows .exe (Electron) via scripts/build-win.mjs -> release/*Setup*.exe
```
Deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main`. **Runtime `public/` asset paths must be
`import.meta.env.BASE_URL`-relative, never a leading slash**, or they 404 under the
`/RC-Dirt-Oval/` subpath (build stays green; live game breaks). Bundle images via `import` from
`src/assets/` to dodge that entirely.
