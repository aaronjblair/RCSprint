# RC Dirt Oval

A browser 3D **1/10-scale dirt-oval RC racing game**, modeled on the real **Team Losi 22S Sprint** (TLR 22 platform). Built with **Babylon.js 7 + Havok (WASM) + Vite + TypeScript** — no engine install, no server. The production build is a static folder you can host anywhere.

- **One unified setup screen** — a single start screen sets your **driver name**, **car class** (Winged Sprint Car / Dirt Late Model), **game mode** (Career/Sim / Arcade), **sound on/off**, and **auto-throttle**, then **START**. Every setting is **persisted and remembered** for next time; changing class or mode reloads and auto-starts.
- **Four camera views** — an elevated **driver-stand** ("Track") vantage that smoothly **follows your car all the way around** (panning into the corners, telephoto-zooming to the far side), a first-person **in-car / cockpit** view that rides in the seat looking out over the nose (roll cage + steering wheel framing it, with a subtle lean into the corners and a faint speed shake), a high **aerial** spectator view, and an **RC Pro-Am overhead** view (your car stays centered while the track scrolls under it — the default in Arcade). The small **upper-left button cycles them**, or press `V`; `C` still quick-toggles aerial. **Manual zoom** works in every view (mouse wheel, `+`/`-`, or the on-screen `±` buttons). A flip is shown from outside, then snaps back to the cockpit.
- **Pause anytime** — `P` (or the ⏸ HUD button) opens a pause menu (**Resume / Restart / Main Menu**); it freezes the sim, the race clock, and the engine sound.
- **Auto-throttle option** — flip it on and the car runs **full throttle always**, leaving **steering as your only input** (the GAS/BRAKE pedals hide on touch). Great for kids and casual play; works on desktop and mobile, and is remembered.
- **Sim-leaning physics** — custom raycast vehicle, slip-based friction-circle tires, throttle-steer, and a visual wheelstand/squat/dive.
- **Two car classes** — pick a **Winged Sprint Car** (light, twitchy, wing downforce, power-oversteer) or a **Dirt Late Model** (heavy, planted, mechanical grip — a low, wide, full-bodied **wedge** with big fenders over the wheels, a small narrow cab set back, tall **sail panels**, a wide flat raked **spoiler**, and a low full-width nose + splitter). Each class drives distinctly and keeps **its own career/championship**.
- **Two game modes** — pick **Career/Sim** (the points-scored championship that always rolls on to the next track) or **Arcade** (RC Pro-Am style) at the start. Arcade puts you under the **overhead Pro-Am camera** with **oil/wet slick patches** to dodge; you rack up a **score** and must finish **top-3 to advance** or burn one of your **continues**. Both modes launch off a drag-strip **light tree** (stage → ambers → green) with a **perfect-launch** boost for nailing the green. `?mode=arcade` (or `career`) forces a mode.
- **Uniform packed-dirt surface** — one even, earthy brown racing surface with no painted groove bands; grip still evolves invisibly per line in `SurfaceModel` (tacky → groove → slick), so the fast line migrates over a run and the **driven racing groove visibly darkens** as the run wears in.
- **Real dirt racecraft AI** — reads the fast groove, passes by taking the line you aren't on, throws **slide jobs**, defends the inside, and races with pace ebbs/bobbles for a dynamic, shuffling pack.
- **Contact that bites** — positional car-to-car and wall contact; a genuinely hard T-bone or wall slam triggers a realistic **multi-axis rollover** that leaves the car **stuck until a track marshal runs out and rights it** (or you tap `R` to bail yourself out).
- **Track marshals** — **6 hi-vis marshals: 2 sit in camp chairs at the two infield ends, and 4 stand outside the track at the corners** (evenly spread, turns 1–4). When a car **wrecks** (stuck upside down) or **stalls** (stopped/pointing the wrong way), the **nearest available** one gets up/jogs across traffic and **places it back on the racing line — upright, facing race direction, ready to continue** — then returns to its post. The marshals all look a little different (varied shirts, hair, and caps).
- **High-revving combustion engine sound** — a **procedural sprint-car engine** (Web Audio): a rich, high-revving player voice whose pitch rises with throttle and speed, with a faint tire-on-dirt hiss, plus a lighter, **stereo-panned, distance-faded engine for every AI car** so the pack reads as a background. It starts on your first click/keypress (browser autoplay rules); **mute with `M` or the 🔊 button** (remembered), and pausing silences it.
- **A flag girl starts every race** — a starter at the start/finish line waves the green flag to send the field off.
- **You drive Super Jay's #32** — the player car is the vibrant **orange #32**: a plain-orange body with a small "Super Jay" by the cockpit and his **logo on top of the all-orange wing** (reading along the car as it passes).
- **Name your driver** — the unified setup screen takes your name (pre-filled **"Super Jay"** — keep it or type your own; blank stays "Super Jay"). Your name is title-cased, remembered between sessions, and shows on the leaderboard. The rest of the field race under **random full names** (e.g. Dale Hutchins, Rusty Calhoun) — stable per grid slot so the season championship adds up.
- **Opening logo + loading bar** — the **SUPER JAY #32** racing badge over a progress bar that fills as the app boots (engine → physics → track → ready), then fades into the game; the splash credits **"Created by Aaron Blair."**
- **Driver's manual** — a polished in-game documentation overlay (controls, racecraft, setup, career) opens from the title screen and the pre-race panel; works on desktop and phone.
- **Cinematic attract intro** — open the app and a TV-style "broadcast" reel plays (AI field racing, cutting between a crane orbit, low trackside, a chase cam, and a flyby); click or press any key to enter the menu.
- **15-track career/championship** — progressively harder dirt ovals that **always roll on to the next track**. The game runs **at night** the whole way — a dark sky with a crescent **moon** and a **starfield** (the **Big Dipper** picked out overhead), lit by **6 lamp towers** (four corners + two mid-straight). Night is the game's signature look.
- **Full 8–12-car fields** (a random count each race), the whole field in your chosen class. The winged sprint is modeled on a real winged dirt sprinter — the **huge top wing** with a down-swept front scoop and tall number side boards, **big staggered tires** (biggest on the right-rear) on **orange beadlock wheels**, a detailed tube front end (axle, 4-bar radius rods, tie rod, front wing), nerf bars, and a roll cage with driver. The AI cars carry **wing-top numbers**, and there's an always-present red/white **#42** in the field. Lettered **Hoosier** dirt slicks, right-rear rooster-tail dust, and **drafting/slingshot** pack racing.
- **A different horizon every round** — each track has its own dirt color and a distinct themed backdrop: red-rock mesas, pine forest, open plains (silos + barn), city skyline, sand dunes, or striped badlands, on a landscape that runs to the horizon. A **grassed infield** carries a large Flora Vista speedway logo sprayed boldly across the surface — with a guy on a red riding mower parked by it for fun. The **drivers' stand is doubled in length** with a **banner** and a **lit booth window**, a row of **varied full-size spectators** up on the deck — different shirts, some in ball caps, some with long hair — **turned to face the track, each holding a little RC transmitter** (with thumbsticks + antenna) like they're the ones driving. Tailgate-party **pickup trucks** (full real-world scale) are parked behind the grandstand and along the east straight.
- **A toy on a real track** — only the **cars and the track** are 1:10 scale; every person, prop, and building (marshals, flag girl, stand, timing booth, lawnmower rider) is **full real-world size** (~1 unit ≈ 1 foot; a standing adult ≈ 5.7u, stand deck ≈ 5u, shack ≈ 9u), so the people clearly tower over the toy cars.
- **Everyone has shoes, hands, and knees** — every procedural person (marshals, the deck spectators, the flag girl, the lawnmower rider) now has visible knee joints, shoes on the ground, and hands; they're rigged onto the same hip/knee/shoulder pivots, so the marshals' jog and the flag wave animate the new parts too.
- **Adaptive graphics quality** — the game auto-tunes its render detail to hold ~60 FPS and climbs back to maximum when the GPU has headroom (a 5-tier ladder over render resolution, anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion, bloom, and sharpening). It starts high on desktop and lighter on phones, and quietly steps up/down as needed.
- **Early-career speed boost** — on career levels 1–7 the **player's car** gets a small power edge (+15% on level 1) that **tapers to zero by level 8**, so the first rounds feel forgiving and the field catches up as you climb. The AI cars are unchanged.
- **Live HUD** — lap/position, **interval gaps** to the cars ahead/behind, last vs best lap, tire wear, track state, minimap.
- **Gamepad / yoke + pedals primary, keyboard fallback.**

## Controls
| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrows / WASD | steer, throttle, brake (steer only when auto-throttle is on) |
| Gamepad | stick = steer, RT/LT = throttle/brake |
| Yoke + pedals | auto-calibrated (steer = centered axis, throttle/brake = pedal axes) |
| `R` | reset car |
| `V` (or the upper-left button) | cycle camera view: Track / In-Car / Aerial / RC Pro-Am |
| `C` | quick-toggle aerial / driver-stand camera |
| Mouse wheel / `+` / `-` | zoom the camera in/out |
| `P` (or the ⏸ button) | pause menu (Resume / Restart / Main Menu) |
| `M` | mute / unmute engine sound |
| `G` | garage / setup panel (gearing, wing, tire, camber, bias) |
| `K` / `J` | recalibrate input rig / swap throttle–brake (sim rigs) |
| Touch | steer pad + GAS / BRAKE / RESET + zoom `±` (GAS/BRAKE hidden when auto-throttle is on) |

## Run it
```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://127.0.0.1:5173
```
Add **`?demo`** to the URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo`) to skip the intro/menu and drop straight into a live race — handy for a quick spectate or sharing a clip. Add **`?round=N`** (1-based, e.g. `?round=11`) to preview a specific career round's track/backdrop without playing up to it; combine them (`?demo&round=11`). Add **`?view=incar`** (or `aerial`/`track`) to force the starting camera, **`?class=latemodel`** (or `sprint`) to force the car class, **`?mode=arcade`** (or `career`) to force the game mode, **`?day`**/**`?night`** to force lighting, and **`?photo`** for a close rear-3/4 view locked to the player car.

## Build & share
```bash
npm run build    # tsc --noEmit (strict typecheck) then vite build -> dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
```
`dist/` is the whole game. It must be **served over http(s)** — opening `index.html` from `file://` won't work (browsers block ES modules + WASM there). See **[DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md)** for itch.io / Netlify / local-server / same-Wi-Fi options.

## Play it / share a live link (GitHub Pages)
**Live:** **https://aaronjblair.github.io/RC-Dirt-Oval/** — open it on a phone or desktop and share it with anyone.

A workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes the game on every push to `main` (Pages source is **GitHub Actions**, set under **Settings → Pages**). **Runtime references to `public/` assets must be `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`-relative, not a leading slash**, or they 404 under the `/RC-Dirt-Oval/` subpath. GitHub Pages is free on **public** repos; private-repo Pages needs a paid plan. The relative `base` in `vite.config.ts` also lets you drag `dist/` straight onto Netlify/itch.io to keep a repo private.

## Install / Download
RC Dirt Oval ships two ways — pick whichever fits your device:

- **Install the app (PWA) — iOS, Android, Windows, Mac.** Open the live URL and add it to your device:
  **https://aaronjblair.github.io/RC-Dirt-Oval/**
  - **iOS (Safari):** Share → **Add to Home Screen**.
  - **Android / desktop Chrome or Edge:** the **Install app** button in the address bar (or the browser menu → *Install*).
  - It installs as a real app with its own icon and runs offline after the first load — the build embeds a web-app manifest and a service worker that precaches the whole game (including the Havok physics `.wasm`).
- **Windows installer (.exe).** A native Windows build (Electron) is published as a **GitHub Release** asset — download the `RC Dirt Oval Setup *.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aaronjblair/RC-Dirt-Oval/releases) and run it.

There are intentionally **no native iOS / Mac / Android store builds** — install the PWA from the URL above instead (it covers all three). See **[DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md)** for the full how-and-why and other hosting options.

> `npm run build` is the only gate — there is no test runner or linter. `tsconfig` is strict (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noImplicitReturns`), so an unused symbol fails the build. Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for a fast typecheck.

## Architecture notes
- **The vehicle is custom and kinematic — not a Havok rigid body.** `RaycastVehicle` integrates its own planar velocity (slip-based tires with a friction circle) and yaw, and raycasts the ground each step for ride height and banking alignment. Havok is used *only* for static track collision and those wheel rays. (Havok v2 `applyForce` on a dynamic body desynced velocity from the mesh, so that approach was abandoned.)
- **Car-to-car contact and wall limits are positional**, resolved in `Field.ts` — not physics bodies.
- **Fixed-timestep accumulator** (`FIXED = 1/60`, up to 6 catch-up steps/frame) keeps the sim at real-world speed regardless of frame rate. Each step calls `Field.update(dt, input, raceFraction)`.
- **Tracks are pure data.** `OvalTrack` builds a counter-clockwise banked oval (2 straights + 2 180° turns) from a `TrackDef`; `generateCareer()` scales radius/length/banking/grip/AI/laps across 15 rounds.
- **Rendering** imports Babylon à la carte (smaller bundle) with the required side-effect imports; environment provides IBL + ACES + bloom + SSAO + sky, with a separate night configuration (dark sky/fog, crescent moon + starfield with the Big Dipper, 6 lit lamp towers). Day/night is per-round (night at rounds 8/12/15); `?day`/`?night` force either. The shadow map refreshes every other frame to save GPU.
- **Race timing & start line.** The **start/finish line** sits about three-quarters of the way down the front stretch, and a race **ends one lap after the winner crosses it** (rather than the instant the leader finishes), so the field gets a clean final lap. Finished cars rank by finish time.
- **Pausing** (`P` / the ⏸ button) freezes the fixed-timestep accumulator, the race clock, and the engine audio, then resumes cleanly; the pause menu can also Restart the race or return to the Main Menu.

## License / assets
Personal project. Dirt textures under `public/textures/` and the `.env` IBL are bundled assets; everything else (geometry, liveries, dust) is generated procedurally at runtime.
