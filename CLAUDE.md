## What this is
RCSprint — a browser 3D 1/10-scale dirt-oval RC sprint car game modeled on the **Team Losi 22S Sprint**. Stack: **Babylon.js 7 + Havok (WASM) + Vite + TypeScript**. Driver-stand camera, sim-leaning physics, 15-track career. The game is **silent** (no audio).

## Hard rules
- **It ships.** `npm run build` → `dist/` must build clean and run from any static host. Use procedural assets or files under `public/`; no server-side dependencies.
- **All cars must look picture-perfect** — every car (player and AI) reads as a clean winged sprint car: four corner tires, wing on, body/livery intact, nothing missing/floating/clipping.
- **World scale: ONLY the cars and the track are 1:10.** Every person/prop/building (track marshals, flag girl, drivers'-stand spectators, lawnmower rider, the drivers' stand, the timing booth) is **full real-world size**: 1 unit ≈ 1 ft, a standing adult ≈ **5.7u**, the stand deck ≈ **5u**, a shack/booth ≈ **9u**, a car ≈ **2.5u**. People tower ~2× a car's height. Scale procedural figures at the **feet** (root origin y=0). See the **world-scale** skill — this rule exists because sizing kept getting redone.
- **Verify on screen, don't just describe.** Screenshot (full grid when touching `Car.ts`, `RaycastVehicle.placeWheels`, or spawning) or read sim state before calling a visual/physics change done — see the **screenshot-game** skill.

## Commands
```
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server at http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run build    # tsc --noEmit (strict) then vite build -> dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build
```
`npm run build` is the only gate (no test runner/linter). `tsconfig` is strict — `noUnusedLocals/Parameters/noImplicitReturns`, so an unused symbol fails the build. Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for a fast typecheck.

In-game: arrows/WASD drive, R reset, C aerial camera, G garage/setup. Gamepad/yoke+pedals take over on actual input.

## Skills (use these — they hold the step-by-step recipes)
- **screenshot-game** — see the running game on the real GPU (headless Chrome; the only reliable view here — the Playwright MCP shot of this WebGL canvas is stale/garbled).
- **add-trackside-actor** — add a procedural figure/prop (marshal, flag girl, sign) and verify it.
- **world-scale** — the sizing rule (only cars/track are 1:10; everyone/everything else is real-world size) + how to apply/verify it.
- **night-sky** — night lighting, the crescent moon + starfield, the lamp towers, and how to actually see them (the bowl cameras pitch past the sky).
- **import-asset** — add an image/texture/binary so it survives dev, the strict build, and the `/RCSprint/` Pages subpath.
- **verify-goals** — a build→probe→screenshot→fix loop that runs until the user's stated goals objectively pass.
- **commit-it** — verify build → reconcile docs → commit → push → confirm the live deploy.

## Architecture
- `src/main.ts` — entry point + game-flow state machine (`attract → prerace → racing → finished`); boots engine, loads the career round, builds track/field, runs the fixed-timestep loop (`FIXED = 1/60`, ≤6 catch-up steps). Exposes `window.__field`, `__track`, `__race`, `__marshals` for tests. **Attract reel:** on first open per tab session (`sessionStorage rcsprint.seen`) all cars are AI-driven (`Field.attractUpdate`) under a cutting `CinematicCamera`; any click/key sets the flag and reloads into the menu with a fresh grid. Career **always advances** to the next (harder) round — no podium gate.
- **The vehicle is custom and kinematic — NOT a Havok body.** `src/physics/RaycastVehicle.ts` integrates its own velocity (slip/friction-circle tire model) + yaw and raycasts the ground for ride height + banking. Havok (`src/physics/PhysicsWorld.ts`) is used **only** for static track collision and wheel rays. Don't make the car a Havok rigid body — that path was abandoned (applyForce desynced velocity from the mesh). Tune via `VehicleConfig`/`DEFAULT_CONFIG` and the slip/grip math.
- Car-to-car contact and wall limits are **positional**, not physics — `src/race/Field.ts` (`resolveContacts`, `wallLimit`), which also owns surface grip, tire wear, dust, and rollovers for the whole field.
- **Rollovers are marshal-gated.** A hard hit (`RaycastVehicle.triggerRollover`) tumbles the car then leaves it **stuck upside down** (`isStuck`, no control/velocity) until a marshal reaches it; `R` (`resetTo`) clears it for the player. `src/race/Marshals.ts` seats **6 full-size track marshals in camp chairs at the two infield ENDS** (`PER_END` each; `SIT_DROP` lowers them to read as seated), updated each frame from `main.ts` with `field.cars`. They sit until trouble: a marshal claims the nearest car that is **wrecked (`isStuck`) OR stalled** (speed `< STALL_SPEED` for `> STALL_TIME` while green — tracked in a per-car map), stands up, jogs to it, and **places it back on the racing line** — upright, facing race direction — via `vehicle.resetTo(pos, yaw)` from `track.project()` (the bottom groove), then returns to its chair and sits. (So marshals reposition onto the track, not just right in place.)
- **A flag girl starts each race.** `src/race/FlagGirl.ts` builds a procedural starter at the start/finish line (`track.sampleAt(0)`); `flagGirl.greenFlag()` (fired from the countdown GO and the `?demo` start) triggers a big green-flag wave that decays back to idle. Built/updated from `main.ts` like the marshals.
- **Easter egg:** `src/race/LawnMower.ts` builds a guy on a red riding mower parked on the infield grass by the logo (static, built from `main.ts`).
- **The car is modeled on a real winged sprinter** (`src/car/Car.ts`): a huge top wing with a **down-swept front scoop** + tall number side boards, **staggered tires** (biggest on the right-rear) on **orange beadlock** wheels, and a detailed tube front end. Tire stagger needs **per-wheel radius** — `WheelDef.radius` feeds `RaycastVehicle.placeWheels` (each tire sits on its own radius); without it all wheels use `cfg.wheelRadius` and big tires sink/float.
- Tracks are data (`src/track/TrackDef.ts`); `OvalTrack` builds the banked oval (plus a **grassed infield** filling the oval with the **Flora Vista speedway logo sprayed flat onto it** — `src/assets/logo.png`, imported as a bundled Vite asset, alpha-blended with a faint emissive so it reads as bold paint; sized large to most of the infield, its long axis running along the straights/z). `src/track/tracks.ts` `generateCareer()` produces the 15 rounds (night rounds 8/12/15, but `main.ts` currently **forces night game-wide** via `def.night = true`). `Scenery.ts` builds trackside (real-size **drivers' stand** with full-size spectators, a **timing booth/shack** with a dark-gray roof on the +z end of the stand, **6 light towers** = 4 corners + 2 mid-straight, start/finish) plus a **per-round themed backdrop** (`TrackDef.backdrop`: mesas/forest/plains/city/dunes/badlands) and a large **world floor** under it (the 400m infield only covers ±200m, so distant scenery needs ground out to the horizon). Career save in `src/career/Career.ts` (localStorage); car setup in `src/car/CarSetup.ts`.
- Rendering: Babylon imported **à la carte** with required **side-effect imports** (materials, shadow/physics components, prepass+geometryBuffer for SSAO2). `src/core/Environment.ts` sets IBL/ACES/bloom/SSAO/SkyMaterial (day + night); its `addNightSky()` adds a **crescent moon** (billboarded carved disc) + a **starfield dome** + a **Big Dipper** asterism (billboarded bright dots, north-up, all `applyFog=false`) at night. Dust/dirt are procedural canvas textures (`src/core/Textures.ts`). The racing surface is **one uniform packed-dirt brown** (no painted groove bands; grip still evolves invisibly in `SurfaceModel`).

## Gotchas (cost real time)
- **Headless sim is slow (~1–5 fps), so render-loop timing misleads.** For deterministic tests, step the sim **synchronously at fixed dt** in `browser_evaluate` and read internal state (`vehicle.heading`, `vehicle.position`) — not `mesh.getDirection()`, which is stale until a render frame. (Adding assets/actors? see the **import-asset** / **add-trackside-actor** skills.)
- **Backdrops barely show in the racing/driver-stand POV** — that elevated camera follows the car and pitches down into the bowl, so distant horizon silhouettes sit above the frame. They read in the **aerial (C) / attract wide** views; verify backdrop changes there (attract reel via `?round=N`), and keep silhouettes tall/close enough to clear the horizon haze.
- **Backdrop instances must never reach inboard of the outfield** (a wide butte/mesa base sitting at the ring radius will overlap the racing surface and "cut off" the track). `buildBackdrop` clamps each instance's radius with `safeR(r, footprint)` to push it out by half its own width; a footprint is closest to the track along **x** (the z ring is stretched ×`zS`). Trim base/height multipliers rather than relying only on distance.
- **Night moon/stars sit ABOVE the bowl-camera frame** (same reason backdrops barely show). Don't conclude "not rendering" from a `?demo`/attract shot — verify by freezing the scene (`scene.onBeforeRenderObservable.clear()`), aiming a camera at `moon.position`, `scene.render()`, then a Playwright screenshot (`maxZ` must exceed the star-dome radius). See the **night-sky** skill.
- **Don't eyeball figure scale from the racing cameras** — they distort size. Probe a figure's world bounding-box height via `browser_evaluate` (expect a person ≈5.7u, feet y≈0). See the **world-scale** / **verify-goals** skills.
- A **Logitech Flight Yoke + CH Pro Pedals** show up as gamepads; a held button can hijack the keyboard. For deterministic tests, override `navigator.getGamepads = () => []`.
- Babylon `ParticleSystem` defaults to **additive blend** — dust looked like glowing embers until set to `BLENDMODE_STANDARD`.
- **Ground moiré** at grazing angles = over-tiled dirt; use `anisotropicFilteringLevel = 16`, modest tiling, lower `bumpTexture.level`.
- `Matrix.InvertToRef` is not static — use `matrix.invertToRef(out)`.
- Camera `maxZ` must stay above the skybox size or the sky clips to black.
- **Tires/wheels: no sidewall or shoulder mesh may exceed the tread radius.** A torus "bulge" sized past the tread reads as Mickey-Mouse ears. Revolve the tire carcass from a cross-section with `MeshBuilder.CreateLathe` (rounded shoulders, square-ish tread) and set the tire material `backFaceCulling = false` (a revolved surface is single-sided). Hoosier lettering goes on a thin sidewall disc with a punched-out center; the chrome **dished** wheel + center nut shows through.

## Windows / PowerShell
- `npm` is `npm.cmd` — `Start-Process "npm"` fails. Run `npm run dev` as a background process instead.
- PowerShell 5.1 has no `&&`. Chain with `;` or `if ($?) { ... }`.
- **Git is installed but NOT on PATH.** Prepend it before any git command: `$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;" + $env:Path`. Use `git --no-pager …` for log/diff. The repo's `origin` is the **public** GitHub repo `aaronjblair/RCSprint` (auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push); commit + push to `main` via the **commit-it** skill.
