/**
 * First-person "in the seat" camera for the player car. A `cockpitEye` node is parented to the car
 * root, so the camera inherits the car's heading/pitch/roll/position automatically (the banking and
 * wheelstand/squat are already part of the motion). On top of that it adds SUBTLE driver feel:
 * a small lean into the corner, a faint speed-scaled shake, and a touch of speed-FOV.
 *
 * Eye sits just above the helmet (clear of the helmet mesh), behind the steering wheel — looking out
 * over the nose with the roll cage to the sides and the top wing high overhead. Local car frame:
 * +Z forward, +Y up. (Helmet ~y0.5, halo ~y0.52, wheel z-0.02, nose z1.05.)
